# Learning Python

Read, write, compile/run, adjust, tweak, compile/run again. This is just my way of playing around with everything I'm learning so far and uploadng to Gtihub so that I can look back over it if I ever wanted.

I type out everything by hand, because I enjoy forcing my brain to remember everything and never rely on code completion or AI.
